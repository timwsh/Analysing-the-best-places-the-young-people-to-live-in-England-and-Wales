# Analysing-the-best-places-the-young-people-to-live-in-England-and-Wales
University students graduate in every September (including myself). Before that, they need to decide where to live and work. In this project, analysis on house price, salary, residentsâ€™ age, suicide rate, and personal well-being estimates on every local authority on the England and Wales.
The results show that if higher salary is desired but affordability for housing is limited:
- For higher disposable income, you may consider St Albans in Hertfordshire, Copeland in Cumbria, and Surrey County to take advantage of the high pay jobs.
- For young age and low suicide rate, Thurrock from Essex is outstanding.
- For overall performance for the rent paid, other than Cumbria County and Thurrock mentioned above, local authorities in the outskirts of London (South East and East of England) can be the choices.
- Fareham is a new discover. Located between Portsmouth and Southampton, it is benefitted from the job opportunities from these 2 cities.
